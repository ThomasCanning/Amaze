This is a visualisation tool for graph search algorithms. 
You are given a 25 by 25 grid and can create a maze of wall pieces with a start and end tile. 
You are then able to select a pathfinding algorithm (at present A* and depth first search) and display the path it finds
This allows you to compare the path found by different algorithms, as well as see a rough time comparison for the time it takes to run
